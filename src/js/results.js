If you are unsure of certain colors, we strongly recommend you request color samples be mailed to you before purchasing. Our samples are free and you can request them by sending us a message. This is also a great idea if you are unsure the decal will adhere to your particular surface.\r\n\r\n*Please be sure to review all of our Shop Policies before purchase. When purchasing, if no color request is left for us to complete your order, the color(s) used in the listing&#39;s example will be sent.  All policies are agreed upon when the listing is purchased.\r\n\r\n*Listings may be enhanced (enlarged or zoomed in on) to show detail.

Photos may be requested.\r\n\r\n**DAMAGED ITEM** \r\nAll On The Wall is not responsible for lost, stolen or damaged items while in the care of USPS. Shipping insurance is available for every order, simply send us a message with your request before purchase and we will set up a Custom Listing for you reflecting the additional insurance. ","policy_additional":"FAQ:\r\n\r\nQ: I love your decals but I need a different size. Can you do this?\r\nA: Of course! We can custom-size any design for you.\r\n\r\nQ: Are your decals easy to install?\r\nA: Very easy! We send simple, step-by-step instructions with each order. \r\n\r\nQ: My walls have a little texture to them. Will your decals stick?\r\nA: Yes - our decals will adhere just fine to lightly textured walls and you will see the texture through our thin, high-quality vinyl. It will look as if the design has been painted on your wall.\r\n\r\nQ: How do I get the decals off when I&#39;m ready to redecorate? Will they damage my walls?\r\nA: To remove the decals, start at a corner and simply peel them away. They will come off easily and will not damage your walls. Landlords love us!\r\n\r\nQ: Can I apply vinyl decals to freshly painted walls?\r\nA: NO! You will need to wait AT LEAST two weeks before applying the vinyl to the wall. If you do not, then the vinyl will not adhere properly.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1460739997,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/AllOnTheWallVinyl?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/6299860\/iusb_760x100.18053131_a07z.jpg","num_favorers":3209,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/132\/0\/6299860\/isla_fullxfull.18435262_thyovdwz.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":0}},{"listing_id":448701120,"state":"active","user_id":24661720,"category_id":68889902,"title":"Levi&#39;s

I make it a priority to give each inquiry the time and attention it deserves.  Because of this, it might take me some time to get to your note, but please know that it&#39;s because I&#39;m making sure I give top quality customer service to each and every one of you, and I&#39;m just working through my list of inquiries until I&#39;ve reached yours.

Loading a JPEG or PNG file to your cutting software and looking for cut lines is akin to loading a photograph you took with your camera and hoping to cut it.  Cutting and outline information is just not programmed into these file types.  You can, of course, use the tracing feature in your software to obtain an outline, but this will never match the quality of the ready-made cutting files included in your download.\n\nI am currently in the process of updating the listing photographs in my shop.  In the meantime, please be aware that the pink background on the older listings is a watermark.  All JPEGs are delivered with a white background.\n\nDo you have any further questions regarding how to use the files here in my shop?

After you have extracted your files, save the DXF file in a convenient location.\n\n2.  Open Silhouette Studio, and select File, Import, Import to Library from the top menu.\n\n3.  Navigate to the location where you saved your files, and select the DXF file.\n\n4.  Your Library will open, and Studio will automatically place the file in your My Own Designs folder.\n\n5.

Navigate to the location where you saved your files, and select the SVG file.\n\n4.  Your Library will open, and Studio will automatically place the file in your My Own Designs folder.\n\n5.  Open the file by double clicking the thumbnail image in your Library.\nTo access the file in the future, select File, Library from the top menu bar.  You will see the file in your My Own Designs folder.\n\nWHY DOES MY SVG FILE SHOW UP AS A BLACK BLOB IN SILHOUETTE STUDIO DESIGNER EDITION?\nThis can happen when you have the program set to merge the layers. Simply right click, and ungroup the image. Then you will be able to access all of the layers and recolor them as needed.\n\nDO YOU SELL .STUDIO FILE TYPES?\nNo, we don\u2019t.  These file types are proprietary to Silhouette America, and their sale by any third party vendor is strictly prohibited.  Instead, please use DXF files for Silhouette Studio Basic Edition, and SVG files for Silhouette Studio Designer Edition.\n\nMAY I SELL PRODUCTS THAT I CREATE WITH THE DESIGNS I PURCHASE HERE?\nThese files are available for PERSONAL and SMALL BUSINESS COMMERCIAL use.  This means that you may use each file you purchase to create any physical object to use personally, give to a friend, or sell a maximum of 100 items via your small business.\n\nHowever, you MAY NOT use the files, or any part of them, to sell digitally in any format, including digitizing the images for resale as embroidery files.  \n\nYou are also prohibited from selling or sharing these files with anybody.  The file you purchase is only licensed for your use.  Should you share it with or sell it to anyone, you are infringing on the SVG Salon terms of use and copyright.\n\nI USE SILHOUETTE BASIC EDITION AND DXF FILES. WHY DO I LOSE SOME PARTS OF THE MONOGRAM LETTERS WHEN I WELD THEM TOGETHER?\nUnlike SVG files, DXF files are composed solely of lines, and don\u2019t contain any fill information.  Because of this, we need to tell Studio which lines go with which letter before welding by making each letter a compound shape. To do this, click and drag around each letter individually, right click, and select compound shape. Once all of your letters are compound shapes, you can then position them and weld them.\n\nYou can find a full tutorial here: \n\nhttps:\/\/svgsalon.com\/tutorials\/using-dxf-files-in-silhouette-studio-basic-edition-to-build-monograms\/\n\nWHY DO MY SVG FILES SHOW UP AS ART5 FILES, AND WHAT CAN I DO TO FIX THIS?\nThis can happen when your files become corrupted during the download process, typically because of a slow download speed, or an interruption in the download.  Please delete your files and go back to your receipt to download a new set.  I recommend ensuring that you don&#39;t have too many other items streaming or using up your bandwidth, to ensure as smooth a download as possible.  :)\n\nI DON&#39;T SEE MY DXF FILE, BUT I DO SEE A 3D OBJECT.  WHAT THE HECK?!\nIf your computer isn&#39;t familiar with DXF files and doesn&#39;t have a program that natively opens them, it may designate the file as a 3D Object instead.  Not to worry, it is indeed a DXF.  Just load it to your cutting software as you normally would.\n\nI DON&#39;T SEE MY SVG FILE, BUT I DO SEE AN INTERNET EXPLORER \/ SAFARI ICON.  IS THIS THE SVG?\nYup!  This is your SVG file.  As above, if your computer isn&#39;t familiar with the SVG file type and doesn&#39;t have a program that natively opens them, it will designate it as an internet file, because it DOES know how to open the image this way (but only the image - it won&#39;t actually open as the cutting file).  With this in mind, never just double click on your file to open it in your cutting program - you must actually go into your cutting software and open the file that way.  See above for exactly how to do so in your software type.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1452706137,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SVGSalon?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/10704139\/iusb_760x100.18196163_3yyq.jpg","num_favorers":6439,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/120\/0\/10704139\/isla_fullxfull.18196119_8pma4808.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":3}},{"listing_id":215139785,"state":"active","user_id":52880705,"category_id":69195469,"title":"Awesome We Kane We Shaw We Crawford Blackhawks t-shirt!
